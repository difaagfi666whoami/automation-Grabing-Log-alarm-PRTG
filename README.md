# automation-Grabing-Log-alarm-PRTG
These code are used to grab all log record From PRTG tools using web scrapping method. as simply like we do it by log in using our PRTG account, then click the menu that appears on the website and so on
But, by we doing this automation method, we can reduce the continuity of the clicking time and mouse movement that we does normally by humans more or less. As human beings, sometimes we can miss a few tasks while doing some activities that require focus and the task is simply boring to do due to its repetition and looping tasks for a period of time. 
From that idea, I hope this task can cut those behaviors to increase our productivity for something else. Of course, this idea appears when i got order from my Supervisor to create Monthly reports. 
For full story how this outcome are made, follow me on medium. I was Posted about how I manage this program into some Dashboard that easy to read :  https://medium.com/@difaagfi1998/mini-portofolio-how-to-create-dashboard-report-using-excel-and-automatic-grabbing-data-from-01bbd96e5c5e
