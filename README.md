# automation-Grabing-Log-alarm-PRTG
This code is used to grab all log records from PRTG tools using a web scraping method, as simply like how we do it by logging in using our PRTG account, then clicking the menu that appears on the website, and so on
But, by using an automation method, we can reduce the continuity of the clicking time and mouse movement that we do normally by humans more or less. As human beings, sometimes we can miss a few tasks while doing some activities that require focus, and the task is simply boring to do due to its repetition and looping tasks for a period of time. 
From that idea, I hope this task can cut those behaviors to increase our productivity for something else. Of course, this idea appears when i got order from my Supervisor to create Monthly reports. 
For the full story of how this outcome was made, follow me on Medium. I was posted about how I manage this program into a Dashboard that is easy to read:  https://medium.com/@difaagfi1998/mini-portofolio-how-to-create-dashboard-report-using-excel-and-automatic-grabbing-data-from-01bbd96e5c5e
I know this self taught projects was not perfect due to a lack of knowledges. Let me know for feedback. Thanks!
